# OOP Exam Generator

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course during my first year of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The main objective was to create an automated system for generating multiple-choice tests. The system includes a question and answer repository, with storage and retrieval functionalities implemented using text files.

## Features

### 1. **Question and Answer Management**
   - Display all questions in the system along with their respective answers, clearly indicating whether each answer is correct.
   - Add new answers to existing questions or add entirely new questions to the repository.
   - Update existing questions and answers to ensure content remains current and accurate.
   - Delete specific answers or entire questions with all associated answers, providing flexibility in maintaining the repository.

### 2. **Test Creation**
   - **Manual Test Creation**: 
     - Specify the number of questions for the test and select questions from the repository.
     - Choose which answers to include, and the system generates a text file with the selected questions and answers.
     - The test always includes the default options "None of the above" and "More than one of the above."
     - A corresponding answer key file is also generated.
   - **Automated Test Creation**: 
     - The system randomly selects questions and answers from the repository, ensuring a balanced mix of correct and incorrect answers.
     - Supports the inclusion of open-ended questions.

### 3. **File Management**
   - Tests and answer keys are saved as text files with timestamps, facilitating easy organization and retrieval.
   - The question repository is saved and loaded from binary files, eliminating the need for re-entering data with each session.

### 4. **Question Metadata**
   - Each question is assigned a unique serial number automatically.
   - Questions can be categorized by difficulty level, including easy, medium, and hard.
   - Supports both multiple-choice and open-ended questions, adding depth to the test creation process.

### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Custom exceptions are thrown for specific errors, such as attempting to generate a test with too many questions or choosing a multiple-choice question with insufficient answers.
   - Ensures a smooth and error-free user experience.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming principles in creating a robust and user-friendly exam generation system. It highlights the importance of modularity, error handling, and data management in software development.
